# Java Fundamentals: The Java Language
Use Java and an Integrated Development Environment (STS/Eclipse, IntelliJâ€¦) to complete the following coding exercises.  
In cases where you need to display values to the screen, you may use `System.out.println()` to display the values to console. If you wish to test your code, you can run it inside the `public static void main(String[] args)` method of a Main class.

### 01) Circle Area Exercise
Create a function that takes a circle radius as a parameter, and return the area of the circle.

### 02) Polygon Perimeter Exercise
Create a function that takes an array of float numbers, representing the side lengths of a polygon, and return the sum of all numbers in the array.

### 03) User Class Exercise
Create a new class, `User`, that contains private class members, setter and getter methods, a default constructor, and an `increaseScoreByOne` method.
 
### 04) Multiple Constructors Exercise: Triangle Class
Create a new class, `Triangle`, that contains private members, multiple constructors, and a `calculatePerimeter` method.

### 05) Method Overload Exercise: Shopping Cart Class
Add a new template `ShoppingCart` that has multiple `addItems` methods that overload each other.

### 06) Class Inheritance Exercise: Employee Class
Create an `Employee` class that contains a private member, a public method, a constructor, and an overloaded `equals` method.
Then create a `Manager` class that inherits from the `Employee` class, and overrides the `hasAdministratorRights` method.

### 07) Exceptions: Glass Class
Create a custom Exception named `GlassOverflownException` that contains a constructor and a `message` member.
Then create a class `Glass` that contains private members, a constructor, and a public method that utilizes the `GlassOverflownException`.

### 08) Packages and Interfaces: Building a Calculator Watch
Create a class `CalculatorWatch` that implements the `IWatch` and `ICalculator` interfaces, you'll need to make.
