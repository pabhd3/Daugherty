# CSS Fundamentals

### Exercise 1:

Style the class “my-button” with the following default style:
1. black background
2. gray text color
3. Text size of 24 pixels
4. Black 1 pixel border
5. Opacity of 40%

When the user hovers over the button, change the background to blue and text color to white. The opacity should be 100%. Make a transition effect for all styles with a duration of 1 second.



### Exercise 2:

In HTML, create a hierarchy of nested divs (`<div>` tags) inside a “main” tag. Use css selectors to ensure that only the first child under “main” gets styling applied. Ensure that no other children under “main” have inherited the style. Don’t use class or id selectors.
