# We don't have py.test on campus machines, and we haven't talked
# about virtual environments yet. This script installs py.test in a
# hidden (but not secret) place for the sake of convenience.
#
# It creates a directory in the current folder and names it
# ".virtualenv". The "." at the beginning makes it invisible when you
# run "ls". To see it you have to run "ls -a".
#
# The script then creates a Python virtual environment in that hidden
# folder and installs py.test for Python3 in there.
#
# Then it starts py.test for you!
